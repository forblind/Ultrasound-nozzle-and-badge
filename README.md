We want our ideas and designs to be accessible worldwide, so our products can improve the quality of life of as many 
visually impaired people as possible. For this reason, all our designs are open source and open hardware, and we 
prioritize minimizing the cost of our production. We want to attract attention of the whole society and professionals 
who develop new technologies to the issues and challenges of visually impaired people.

Because of that we use croudsourcing platforms to fund and promote our designs. Anybody can join our community and to help
us reach the set goals in making the world a better place for visually impaired people.
